# Advanced Water Management System for Long Agricultural Form
<details>
  <summary><h2>Abstract</h2></summary>
<br>
  
#### The Advanced Water Management (AWM) system integrates smart controllers and environmental sensors to optimize irrigation practices. It utilizes climate-based and soil moisture controllers, along with sensors such as the DHT22 and water level indicators, to enable efficient and automated water usage in agricultural applications.

Advanced Water Management: Central system designed to optimize irrigation using automated sensing and control.

Controllers: Devices that make decisions based on sensor data to regulate water usage.

Climate-based Controllers: Adjust irrigation based on environmental conditions like temperature and humidity.

Soil Moisture Controllers: Manage water supply according to real-time soil moisture levels.

Sensors: Devices that collect environmental data for accurate water management.

Soil Moisture Sensor: Detects the moisture content in the soil to prevent over- or under-watering.

DHT22: A digital sensor that measures ambient temperature and humidity.

Water Level Indicator: Monitors the level of water in tanks or reservoirs to avoid overflow or shortage
